**Project 2: Performance Tracking Dashboard**

I developed a Power BI dashboard to track targets and achievements over time. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs), channel-wise brand contributions, and unique outlet performance (ECO) across various categories. It also includes metrics such as order vs. issue, issue vs. delivery, and delivery loss, providing a comprehensive overview of performance and supporting strategic decision-making.

**Project 3: Comprehensive Progress Dashboard**

I designed a Power BI dashboard to showcase progress against targets, with detailed breakdowns by quarters, weeks, and other time periods. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs), growth trends, and contributions by category and channel. It also features ECO performance analysis, growth insights, and a geographic map view for stock levels, offering a well-rounded perspective for analyzing current performance and planning for the future.

**Project 4: Enhanced Dashboard with Expanded Features**

This project builds on the work from Projects 2 and 3, incorporating updated Power BI visuals and additional components. New features include an assortment report, an angels report view, and detailed DH coverage analysis. These enhancements make the dashboard more robust and valuable for performance tracking and strategic planning.
