## **Project 1: Avengers Dashboard**  
I created an Avengers-themed dashboard as my first Power BI project. This project marked the beginning of my journey in learning and working with Power BI. In this Power BI template, I created a **Sales Officer-wise ranking** with an Avengers theme, aiming to motivate sales officers to perform in a competitive, goal-oriented environment, creating a **challenging, competitive atmosphere** rather than just tracking their performance against targets.

### Description:  
This project focuses on **motivating and engaging sales officers** through a competitive environment using the Avengers theme. It aims to foster a **challenging, goal-oriented atmosphere** by presenting a **Sales Officer-wise ranking**, making the performance tracking more interactive. The ultimate goal is not only to monitor performance but to enhance motivation through a **fun, engaging interface** that promotes continuous improvement.

## **Project 2: Performance Tracking Dashboard**  
I developed a Power BI dashboard to track **targets and achievements** over time. The dashboard highlights **key performance indicators (KPIs)**, channel-wise brand contributions, and unique outlet performance (**ECO**) across various categories. It also includes metrics such as **order vs. issue**, **issue vs. delivery**, and **delivery loss**, providing a comprehensive overview of performance and supporting strategic decision-making.

## **Project 3: Comprehensive Progress Dashboard**  
I designed a Power BI dashboard to showcase progress against **targets**, with detailed breakdowns by **quarters, weeks, and other time periods**. The dashboard includes **key performance indicators (KPIs)**, **growth trends**, and **contributions by category and channel**. It also features **ECO performance analysis**, **growth insights**, and a **geographic map view for stock levels**, offering a well-rounded perspective for analyzing current performance and planning for the future.
